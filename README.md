# NLP Emotion Classification
This is a project I completed for fun to learn more about machine learning and specifically Natural Language Proccessing. I used this data set (https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp) from Kaggle to train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to take in a sentence and output a relevant emotion associated with the text. The model acheived a 94% accuracy in correctly predicting the emotion out of the 6 given classes: joy, anger, love, sadness, fear, suprise. 

## What I learned
- The fundamentals on natural language processing including how to tokenize and pad sentance training data and why it is important.
- How to import training data using Pandas.
- How LSTM's work and how to construct an optimal model architecture using them in Keras.
- How to save and load a model for later use.

## Instructions
If you want to test run the model, simply run the download the model weights and run the test.py file.
